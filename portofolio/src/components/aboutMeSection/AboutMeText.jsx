      <p className='text-white'>
        I'm a final-year Telecommunication System student at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, 
        passionate about combining technology and creativity. With a strong focus on web development, 
        UI/UX design, and cloud-based innovation, I bring a blend of technical skills and creative thinking. 
        Iâ€™ve also contributed to publications, managed digital communications, and led organizational finance 
        with transparency. Beyond code, I love crafting clean designs, creating engaging presentations, 
        and solving real-world problems with thoughtful solutions.
